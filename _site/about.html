<p class="text">My name is Sudhip Nashi and I'm (as of May 2025) a rising sophomore studying both Computer Science
    and Linguistics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I'm currently interested in ML and
    multilingual NLP, but like any sophomore who does not know what they are doing this is subject to change. In my free time, I love learning languages, reading, and staying active. Not sure what else to put on here, so I'll cut it short. Thanks for stopping by :) </p>

<p class="text">Also did you try clicking the celestial body on the home page? You should do so...</p>
