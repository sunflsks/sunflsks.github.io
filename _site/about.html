<p class="text">My name is Sudhip Nashi and I'm (as of May 2025) a rising sophomore studying both Computer Science
    and Linguistics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I'm currently very interested in databases and data management, especially vector databases and finding ways to speed them up. In my free time, I love learning languages, reading, and staying active. Thanks for stopping by :) </p>
